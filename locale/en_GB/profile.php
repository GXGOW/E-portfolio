    'p1' => 'My name is Nicolas Loots and I live in a small, humble but beautiful city of Hamme, together with my partents,
    my elder brother Laurent and my younger sister Xandrine. Ever since I got my first pc, I\'ve been fascinated by them.',
    'p2' => 'In high school I studied Latin-Science at the Sint-Jozefinstituut in Hamme. Currently, I\'m studying applied computer sciences
    in college at Hogeschool Gent.',
    'h2' => 'Interests',
    'p4' => 'My primary interest, of course, is IT, but I\'m also very interested in science, even though I sucked at it in high school.
    Anyway, I\'m still amazed at the fact that it keeps evolving at this rate and that we\'re continually seeing new breakthroughs.
    The same trend is visible in IT. Newer, faster and better devices and software are being released practically at the speed of light.
    I\'m proud to be living in this day and age, that I\'m able to experience these evolutions. I hope, one day, that I\'ll be able
    to contribute a little to these evolutions.',
    'p5' => 'Let me explain my interests in IT a little further. I\'ve been an Android \'power user\' since a few years, which
    means I\'m a more experienced, advanced user and can customize these devices as much as I want while still knowing what
    I\'m doing. Apart from that, I\'m also a dedicated gamer, but I\'ll dive deeper into that <a href="hobby.php">here</a>',
    'p6' => 'IT isn\'t my only interest, luckily, otherwise my life would be pretty boring. I\'m a cat lover, they\'ve been
     a part of my life for almost my entire lifetime. Currently, we have four cats at home. They can be cute sometimes,
     but they can also cause a lot of stress, pain and agony. Oh well, life isn\'t an ice cream truck'
