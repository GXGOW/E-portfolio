            how to gradually build a website with HTML and CSS. After each course, we had the opportunity to implement
            new things in this website which we had learned. I chose to implement it in the style of Breaking Bad, because at the time
            I was a big fan of the series.'

            Of course, most parties need some publicity, which can be achieved through social media and of course a website.
            Their website was a little dated, so I chose to rewrite the whole thing. It was also a good exercise for me
             to let HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, AJAX and a few frameworks work together. I also learned to take other things into account, 
             like performance, loading times, page sizes, etc. The webserver, on which the website is being hosted, isn\'t one
             of the fastest in the world, so this was a bottleneck I had to work around. Luckily, I got around that and learned
             a few things from it.

        \"It doesn\'t work on my machine\". Only one command is needed to get it up and running. This means that one can easily help the Dogecoin 
        community by keeping a copy of the blockchain and sharing it with other nodes, making transactions easily available to all its users.'),
