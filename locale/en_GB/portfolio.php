            how to gradually build a website with HTML and CSS. After each course, we had the opportunity to implement
            new things in this website which we had learned. I chose to implement it in the style of Breaking Bad, because at the time
            I was a big fan of the series.'

            of Javascript. To make practicing a little more fun, I involved our Lord and Saviour Donald J. Trump. The whole
            world doesn\'t really take him seriously anyway, so here\'s my addition.',

            for the past few years already. In the meantime it has grown to be one of the biggest parties of the city of Hamme.
            Of course, most parties need some publicity, which can be achieved through social media and of course a website.
            Their website was a little dated, so I chose to rewrite the whole thing. It was also a good excercise for me
             to let HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, AJAX and a few frameworks work together. I also learned to take other things into account, 
             like performance, loading times, page sizes, etc. The webserver, on which the website is being hosted, isn\'t one
             of the fastest in the world, so this was a bottleneck I had to work around. Luckily, I got around that and learned
             a few things from it.
