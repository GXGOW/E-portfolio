    'p1' => 'This page will tell you a little more about my hobbies and other things that keep me busy.',
    'h1' => 'Gaming',
    'p2' => 'Like I already mentioned on my Profile page, I\'m a dedicated gamer. That\'s why I spent most of my free time playing 
    games. However, due to my work for school, my amount of free time has gone down significantly. I mostly play shooters, like
    Call of Duty, Counter Strike, Battlefield and freeroam games like Grand Theft Auto. There\'s also more nostalgic titles
    on my list, like the Age of Empires series. This is only a fraction of my gaming collection, I could keep talking about it for hours, 
    but I guess I\'d need a separate website for that.',
    'h2' => 'Music',
    'p3' => 'I also listen to music very often. Not the mainstream pop music, but some of the more heavy genres like metal and
    many of its subgenres. Some of my favourite bands are Five Finger Death Punch, Parkway Drive, Bring Me The Horizon, Trivium, 
    and many more. I listen mostly, but not exclusively, to these genres. My music library mainly consists of metal and its
    subgenres, but there\'s other stuff in there too, like classic rock, drum&bass, hardstyle, hiphop, etc.',
    'p4' => 'Apart from that, I\'ve been playing classical guitar for the past 11 years and electric guitar for the past 
    8 years. Lately, it\'s only the latter I\'ve been playing on. My love for the aforementioned genres reflects itself on
    the songs I play on my guitars. The sweet sounds of Bullet For My Valentine, Metallica, Crown The Empire, Papa Roach
    and many others are mostly blasting through my amplifier.',
    'video' => '',
    'h3' => 'KLJ',
    'image' => '',
    'p5' => 'Like most youngsters in this country, I\'m a member of a youth movement, that is KLJ Hamme-Center. I\'ve been
    a part of it for the past 5 years and I\'m not planning to quit anytime soon. Every time, we\'re having a lot of fun,
    there always is a good atmosphere and the ties between me and the other members, my friends, are only being strengthened.
    So in my opinion, in case you\'re not part of a youth movement, you\'re missing out on a lot of fun, 
    especially when you\'re not part of the KLJ.',
    'h4' => 'Sports',
    'p6' => 'During the past few years, I\'ve played a few different kinds of sports. I\'ve played basketball for five years 
    with BBC Hamme, played badminton for three years with BC Haminton and went to the fitness for two years. The main reasons
    why I quit these sports were lack of time or lack of fun, mostly lack of time. School began taking more and more of my 
    free time, so I had less time to spend on sports. Sometimes I just started to get tired of playing them. Unfortunately, I had to quit them.',
    'p7' => 'Of course, staying out of shape isn\'t an option, so some time ago, I decided it was time to start working on it again. 
    This decision came mostly thanks to my girlfriend. She started running again and asked if I would join her. 
    I agreed, because I was in really bad shape at the time. Nowadays it\'s easier to start to run thanks to the abundance of 
    running-apps. They\'ve helped my girlfriend and me a lot at staying in good shape.'
